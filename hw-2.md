<h2>What are you building?</h2>

<p>
We are building a website that facilitates DIY(Do-It-Yourself) couples therapy. It allows two users (ideally a couple) to create a joint account and input suggestions that their partner could implement to improve their relationship. These suggestions will generate actionable results i.e. links to external reading, youtube videos, ibooks, Amazon wishlists, groupon etc. Users can specify that suggestions are returned from one or more of the 5 love languages.
<br>
The 5 love languages are: 
<ul><li>Words of affirmation</li>
<li>Acts of service</li>
<li>Gift giving</li>
<li>Quality time</li>
<li>Physical touch</li></ul>
For example: if you want your partner to improve on quality time, you input that suggestion and the resulting actionable item could be a link to a skydiving website. We will add lists of actionable items and use a randomizer to gamify the activity for users.

<h2>What does it do and what kind of problem does it solve?</h2>

<p>NHS mental health services and counselling lists currently boast over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/29/strain-on-mental-health-care-leaves-8m-people-without-help-say-nhs-leaders">year-long wait times</a> and private therapy can set couples back anywhere from £60-£250+ per session. This, in combination with the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-you-may-experience-social-anxiety-as-you-emerge-from-the-pandemic">social awkwardness resulting from multiple lockdowns</a> and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/07/20/romantic-relationships-are-being-affected-by-cost-of-living-crisis-17034085/">cost of living crisis</a>, may make confronting relationship issues without support, rather daunting. 
Our DIY couples therapy site allows couples to generate problem-solving actionable results that could save relationships. Sometimes telling your other-half exactly what you need or what would help is difficult to confront and articulate. Rather than writing out a demanding, extensive list of dissatisfaction, why not gamify the whole situation? 
Our site removes the direct confrontational aspects of communication and offers a subtler yet equally effective solution. It provides an alternative way to work through relationship problems and gain a better understanding of each other in a fun way. Couples may want to improve their relationship without involving a third party and without the hefty price-tag. Additionally, this can all be done from the comfort of their own home. It  gives individuals a great opportunity to reflect on how they show and receive love, encouraging growth individually as well as together.

<h2>What are the key features of your system?</h2>

<p><b>Randomiser</b> - results will be randomly generated in the back-end within each specific category when users specify a love language. For example, the back-end could consist of the following options:

<ul><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fluffyamericanpancak_74828">A breakfast recipe</a> and <a href="https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do">shopping list</a>, encouraging them to prepare breakfast for their partner before work</li>
<li>A link to purchase a <a href="https://www.care.com/en-gb/">house-cleaning voucher</a></li>
<li>A link to <a href = "https://www.americancarwash.co.uk/offers/">a car-wash voucher</a></li>
<li>A link to their favourite deliveroo order</li>
<li>Do the laundry</li>
<li>Take out the trash</li>
<li>Pick up the mail</li>
<li>Pick up your partner from the airport at 3am from <a href = "https://www.heathrow.com/transport-and-directions/heathrow-parking">London Heathrow Carpark</a></li>
<li>Leave a <a href="https://www.paperchase.com/en_gb/">note</a> in their work supplies</li>
</ul>
If a user’s partner specifies ‘Acts of service’ as their love language, the back end will select one option from the above database at random.

<b>Love language selector</b> - displayed as a button, users are able to specify that they would like actionable results to be generated for their partner within a specific category. 
<br>
<b>Suggestion inputter</b> - developers can add new suggestions and specify which category of love language they fit into. 
<br>
<b>Suggestion outputter</b> - users receive a range of suggestions ie. links to external reading, youtube videos, ibooks, Amazon wishlists, groupon etc.
<br>
<b>Home/login page</b> - area to input partner’s name and details (in order to create their profiles) and to specify love language. 
<br>
<b>Love language quiz</b> - When a user signs in, they’re greeted with a link to the love language quiz which they must complete in order to proceed. 
<br>
<b>Clinical therapy option</b> - a page with listed clinical therapists for couples to contact. Couples must have tried at least 3 suggestions of a love language before they can ‘unlock’ this feature (for couples with a more serious problem). We will be using elif python functions to prevent people who have yet to try 3 suggestions from accessing this feature. 
<br>
<b>Note section</b> - Before proceeding to the love language action items randomizer, couples will have to input their love language test result from: https://5lovelanguages.com/quizzes/love-language into this section on their joint account so that each person can understand each other’s love language spectrum and show love accordingly.</p>
